# Content

- [`deep_learning.ipynb`] contains the deep learning code and the codes to generate signal with white noise for master euqation fitting.
- [`fitting euqation.nb`] contains the fitting equation derived from the optical Bloch equations.
- [`4bins_fitting.nb`] contains the fitting results of the master equation for 4 mw bins with \Delta f=2MHz and the fitting results for addition of white noise.
- [`20bins_fitting.nb`] contains the fitting results of the master equation for 20 mw bins with \Delta f=2MHz.
- [`200MHz_fitting.nb`] contains the fitting results of the master equation for 4 bins with \Delta f=200MHz.

Note that before running the fitting for addition of white noise in `4bins_fitting.nb`, the code in section "Data for additional noise" of `deep_learning.ipynb` must be run first.
